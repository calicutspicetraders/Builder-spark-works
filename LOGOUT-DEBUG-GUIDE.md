# üîç Logout Debug Guide

## **How to Test if Logout is Fixed**

### **1. Check Browser Console**

When you click logout, you should see these messages:

```
Logout button clicked, current user: [User Object]
Logout function called, redirecting...
Logout initiated
User state changed: { user: null, isAuthenticated: false }
Logout completed, user should be null: { user: null, isAuthenticated: false }
```

### **2. Check localStorage**

**Before logout:**

- Open Dev Tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
- Should see: `user_data`, `auth_token`

**After logout:**

- Should see: `user_logged_out: "true"`
- Should NOT see: `user_data`, `auth_token`

### **3. Visual Indicators**

**Before logout:**

- Navigation shows user avatar
- User dropdown menu visible

**After logout:**

- Page redirects to homepage
- No user avatar visible
- Authentication section should appear (if no invite code)

### **4. If Logout Still Doesn't Work:**

The issue might be:

**A) React State Not Updating:**

- Check console for "User state changed" messages
- If missing, React state isn't updating properly

**B) Page Not Redirecting:**

- Check if `window.location.href = "/"` executes
- Try refreshing page manually after logout

**C) Auto-Login Still Happening:**

- Check if there are other components creating users
- Verify localStorage is actually cleared

**D) Browser Cache:**

- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Try incognito/private mode

## **Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Navigate to any page** in the app
3. **Click user avatar** ‚Üí dropdown opens
4. **Click "Log out"** ‚Üí watch console messages
5. **Check localStorage** ‚Üí should show `user_logged_out: "true"`
6. **Refresh page** ‚Üí should stay logged out

---

## **Quick Fix if Still Broken:**

If logout still doesn't work, try this manual approach:

```javascript
// Paste this in browser console to force logout:
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
window.location.reload();
```

This will completely clear all storage and reload the page.

**Expected Result:** User should be completely logged out and stay logged out until they explicitly log back in.
